      This data set includes spatially explicit mark-recapture data of the
Northern Spring Salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) collected during
the summer months (June – August) from downstream and upstream reaches
in multiple streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Downstream
reaches begin at the confluence with the Main Hubbard and extend
upstream 500 meters and upstream reaches begin at the weir and extend
downstream 500 meters. Downstream reaches contain brook trout and
upstream reaches do not. We used a robust design framework with
approximately 9 surveys per reach each summer (3 primary occasions with
3 secondary occasions each). Salamanders were captured by hand and
marked with either Visual Implant Elastomer and/or a PIT tag.
      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
(HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook
Experimental Forest, which is operated and maintained by the USDA Forest
Service, Northern Research Station.

          Capture–mark–recapture (CMR) surveys were conducted mid-June through mid-September of 2012–2015 and 2018-2021 for three streams (Bear Brook, Paradise Brook, and Zigzag Brook). 
CMR surveys were conducted for two additional streams (Canyon Brook and Cascade Brook) from 2012-2014. 
Each stream was divided into two 500‐m‐long reaches (downstream and upstream), except for Upper Canyon which was only 330-m long.
Downstream reaches started at the confluence with Hubbard Brook and weirs set the upstream end of the upstream reaches. 
Distances between upstream and downstream reaches varied by 400, 0, 0, 250, and 500 m in Bear, Canyon, Cascade, Paradise, and Zigzag Brooks, respectively.
Each stream was surveyed nine times in each field season. We conducted three surveys of each stream during three two-week periods distributed evenly throughout the field season (i.e. primary number). In each survey, a constant search effort was maintained by turning one cover object per meter of stream length. Salamanders were individually marked with visible implant elastomer from 2012-2015 and 8-mm PIT-tags from 2018-2021, then returned to the same location where they were found (i.e., cover object and meter of stream).
          All G. porphyriticus individuals were photographed to quantify body morphology. Animals were placed on a level stage with the camera approximately 20 cm above the stage, which allowed us to photograph the entire dorsal surface of the animal, along with a ruler. The ruler was used to calibrate morphological measurements in mm. We used these photographs to measure head, trunk, and leg morphology, as well as SVL, the standard measure of body size in amphibians. We also recorded the habitat (riffle, pool) where each salamander was captured, based on flow and gradient conditions 0.5 m upstream and downstream of a salamander’s location.
We also recorded the meter location (LongLoc) where we captured each individual, such that locations at the confluence of the Hubbard Brook were 0 and increased by meter of stream length as you moved upstream.
